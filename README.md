Angry Birds stage 2.5 with Class Inheritance and Images

Pot
Colander
Saucepan

INGREDIENTS
12 nixtamalised corn tortillas preferably La Tortilleria
150 grams potatoes
4 tbsp olive oil
½ tsp salt
½ cup vegetable milk recommend almond or soy
4 tbsp vegetable oil
12 toothpicks
¼ lettuce diced
¼ coriander bunch
5 radishes, sliced
guacamole
red salsa

INSTRUCTIONS
Place the potatoes in a pot and cover in water. Bring to boil and once boiling bring the flame down to medium and let it cook for 15-20 minutes or until potatoes are tender.
Pour the content of the pot into a colander and leave the potatoes there to cool down and remove excess water for 5 minutes.
Place the potatoes in a bowl, add the olive oil and salt and then smash them using a fork or masher. Then add the milk and continue smashing until you achieve a smooth consistency.
Reheat the tortillas and place them in a tortilla warmer or tea-towel so they stay soft.
Grab one tortilla at a time and put a tablespoon full of potato mash and extend along the tortilla. Roll the tortilla and place a toothpick horizontally to keep the tortilla rolled. Do the same for the rest of the tortillas.
On a very hot saucepan add a tablespoon of vegetable oil and put 3 to 4 tortilla rolls. Every minute flip the rolls so all sides are fried. Fry them for a maximum of 5 minutes or until crunchy. Place the rolls on a plate with paper towels to absorb the excess oil.
Repeat step 6 for the remainder of the tortilla rolls.
Place the tortilla rolls (or flautas) on a plate and cover with lettuce on top. Then add the radish slices, coriander, guacamole, and salsa on top.
